# Claude ↔ Codex Compatibility

Convert an existing project so both **Claude Code** and **Codex CLI** read the same canonical agent context without duplication.

## Target Architecture

```
repo/
├── CLAUDE.md                  # single line: @AGENTS.md
├── AGENTS.md                  # canonical context, 60-70 lines, references rules by path
├── .agents/rules/             # single source of truth — path-scoped rule files
├── .claude/
│   ├── rules → ../.agents/rules   # symlink; Claude auto-loads
│   └── CLAUDE.md                  # gitignored — personal per-project (Claude)
└── .gitignore                 # ignores .claude/CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.override.md
```

## How each agent discovers context

| Agent | Mechanism | Covers shared? | Covers per-path rules? |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` import; `.claude/rules/*.md` auto-loaded recursively (symlinks supported) with `paths:` frontmatter | Yes | Yes (auto, path-gated) |
| Codex CLI | Native `AGENTS.md` walk-up discovery; at most ONE file per directory; precedence `AGENTS.override.md > AGENTS.md` | Yes | No (agent must `Read` the file when in scope) |

Official docs:
- Claude Code — https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory (imports, `.claude/rules/`, symlinks)
- Codex CLI — https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md (precedence, no imports, override replaces)

## Known tradeoffs — state these honestly

1. **Codex has no `@file` imports.** Rule files are referenced by path string in AGENTS.md; the agent must `Read` them manually when it touches a matching path.
2. **Codex loads one file per directory.** A repo-root `AGENTS.override.md` *replaces* (does not merge with) the shared `AGENTS.md`. The native equivalent of Claude's gitignored `.claude/CLAUDE.md` is therefore `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (user-global, outside the repo). Using `AGENTS.override.md` in-repo requires duplicating shared content.
3. **`paths:` frontmatter on rule files.** Claude honors it natively (loads only when matching files are read). Codex treats it as documentation only.

## Execution Checklist

### Step 1 — Inventory

```bash
ls -la CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md .claude/rules .agents/rules 2>&1
wc -l AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md 2>&1
grep -nE "\.claude/CLAUDE\.md|AGENTS\.override\.md" .gitignore 2>&1
```

Report what exists, what's missing, what's over the 60-70 line budget.

### Step 2 — `CLAUDE.md`

Overwrite with exactly one line (no trailing prose):

```
@AGENTS.md
```

### Step 3 — `AGENTS.md` (target: 60-70 lines)

**Prepend this block at the top of the file if not already present (verbatim):**

```markdown
## MANDATORY: Read Before Any Task

### Core Pillars

0. **Don't pander to the user, always be critical when necessary**
1. **Maximize simplicity, minimize complexity.** Weigh complexity cost against improvement magnitude.
2. **All signal, zero noise.** Everything must earn its place. If it doesn't add value, remove it.
3. **Zero regression policy.** Verify with all three test suites (unit, VP E2E, API E2E) after every change.
4. **Document every discovery.** Write insights immediately (chronicles, plans, rules).
5. **Comments explain why, not what.** Comment non-obvious business logic, flows, and workarounds only.
6. **Refactoring objective:** clear, descriptive, efficient, performant, reliable, robust, maintainable.

CRITICAL: USE ALWAYS THE PLUGIN "development-skills" FOR EVERY TASK ON THIS PROJECT (BRAINSTORMING, DEVELOPMENT, BUG FIXING, NEW FEATURE, ...) IF THE PLUGIN IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE USER SYSTEM, NOTICE IT AND TELL THE USER TO DOWNLOAD IT
```

Keep only what earns its place:
- Project scope (1-2 sentences) + critical domain distinctions
- Safety rules (tables beat prose)
- Testing essentials (commands only)
- **Rules index table** — one row per file in `.agents/rules/`, columns: `Rule | Scope (paths:) | Topic`
- Pointer to Local Machine Instructions (Step 6)

Trim: redundant prose, verbose explanations, duplicated content. **If it's in a rule file, reference — never duplicate.**

### Step 4 — `.agents/rules/` (single source of truth)

- If the directory doesn't exist, create it.
- Every rule file MUST start with YAML frontmatter declaring scope:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/**"
  - "shared/models/**"
---
```

- One topic per file, descriptive filename (e.g., `api-patterns.md`, `sql-architecture.md`).
- Every rule file MUST be referenced in the AGENTS.md index table. Add missing rows, remove stale rows.

### Step 5 — `.claude/rules` symlink

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
[ -e .claude/rules ] || ln -s ../.agents/rules .claude/rules
```

Commit the symlink. Git stores it natively on Unix.

### Step 6 — Gitignore personal-instruction slots

Append to `.gitignore` if missing:

```
.claude/CLAUDE.md
AGENTS.override.md
```

Tell the user:
- **Claude:** put personal instructions in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded, gitignored).
- **Codex:** put personal instructions in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (user-global, outside repo — native equivalent). `AGENTS.override.md` is available but replaces shared AGENTS.md; avoid unless scoped to a subdirectory.

### Step 7 — Self-verify

```bash
wc -l AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
[ "$(cat CLAUDE.md | tr -d '[:space:]')" = "@AGENTS.md" ] && echo "CLAUDE.md OK"
readlink .claude/rules
diff <(ls .claude/rules/) <(ls .agents/rules/) && echo "symlink resolves OK"
git check-ignore -v .claude/CLAUDE.md AGENTS.override.md
```

Report to the user:
- Final AGENTS.md line count (must be ≤ 70)
- Rule files present vs rows in AGENTS.md index (must match)
- Symlink resolution status
- Gitignore entries added

## Hard Gates

- **STOP** if CLAUDE.md is not exactly `@AGENTS.md`.
- **STOP** if AGENTS.md exceeds 70 lines — trim further.
- **STOP** if any rule file lacks `paths:` frontmatter (it would unconditionally load into Claude's context every session).
- **STOP** if any rule file exists under `.agents/rules/` but is absent from the AGENTS.md index table.

## Rules

- **Preserve all load-bearing content** from the original AGENTS.md (safety rules, domain glossary, test commands, rules index). Only trim redundancy.
- **Match the original voice and conventions.** Do not rewrite tone.
- **Never add Codex import syntax** — it does not exist.
- **Never commit** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.override.md`.

## Anti-patterns

Bad — imagined Codex import:
```markdown
# AGENTS.md
@rules/src-patterns.md
```

Good — textual reference in index table:
```markdown
| `.agents/rules/src-patterns.md` | `src/**`, `shared/**` | SS patterns, SQL parameterization |
```

Bad — rule file with no frontmatter (auto-loads every session, bloats Claude context):
```markdown
# API Patterns
All endpoints use...
```

Good — path-scoped rule:
```markdown
---
paths:
  - "api/**"
  - "shared/models/**"
---
# API Patterns
```

Bad — `AGENTS.override.md` committed alongside `AGENTS.md` with duplicated content (two sources of truth).

Good — personal Codex instructions in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; `AGENTS.override.md` used only for intentional per-repo overrides and gitignored.
